# Money$ense

Money$ense is a platform where users can learn about different ways to invest their money (stocks, mutual funds, GICs, etc.), how mortgages and debt work, how financing works, and many more aspects of personal finance that are not taught in school and that are hard to learn by yourself.
- Gamified learning.
- Personalised learning pathways.
- Lessons on debt, mortgages, taxes, financing and more personal finance topics.


## What was Money$ense built on: 
- Money$ense is a web-based application that uses the strengths of both React and Spring.
- A tool that was used from Spring was its Spring Security library. More specifically this blocks certain HTTP requests based on the role of the account that is currently authenticated.
- Further secured using JWT (JSON Web Token), which is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- Finally, our prototype was built with a minimalistic, sleek design in mind. The idea was to allow first-time users to easily use our system by being familiar with the buttons and functionality we used. We incorporated a consistent layout to aid with usability, an easy to follow content hierarchy to improve flow and enjoyable yet simple colors to attract our users.
- The initial page displays a carousel with the many topics we provide lessons on and a simple navigation bar that allows users to easily travel across the pages of the application.
